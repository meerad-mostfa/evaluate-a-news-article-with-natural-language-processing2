Body Section:
Header: Contains a logo and a navigation bar.
Main:
Form Section: A form with an input field for a URL and a submit button.

applyStyles Function: Dynamically adds CSS styles.
checkForName Function: Alerts a message based on whether the input name matches predefined captain names.
handleSubmit Function: Handles form submission, performs a POST request to a local server, and updates the results section with the response.
Event Listener: Adds the submit event listener to the form and attaches handleSubmit function.
4. Service Worker (service-worker.js)
Handles dynamic module loading and caching:

Dynamic Module Loading: Implements module loading logic and defines how to handle module imports.
Workbox Integration: Uses Workbox to precache specified files and manage routing for fetch requests.
5. Workbox (workbox.js)
Contains code for handling caching and routing:

Router Class: Handles routing and request management.
precacheAndRoute Function: Configures Workbox to precache files and set up route handlers.
6. Source Code (src)
JavaScript
formHandler.js: Manages form submission by calling checkForName and making a POST request to a server endpoint. Displays results or error messages based on the server's response.
nameChecker.js: Contains a function to validate names and display an alert message.
Styles (styles)
base.scss: Basic layout and styling for the body and main content.
footer.scss: Styles specific to the footer and form input elements.

7. Webpack Configurations
webpack.config.js: General Webpack configuration for managing JavaScript and CSS files, setting up output paths, and including plugins.
webpack.dev.js: Development-specific Webpack configuration with plugins for handling JavaScript and SCSS, setting up the development server.
webpack.prod.js: Production-specific Webpack configuration, including plugins for extracting CSS, generating HTML, and setting up Workbox for service worker support.
8. Server (index.js)
Server Setup: Uses Express to serve static files and handle API requests.
API Route: Handles POST requests to analyze sentiment using the MeaningCloud API.
Error Handling: Processes and returns sentiment analysis results or error messages based on API responses.
9. Environment Variables (.env)
API Key: Stores the API key for MeaningCloud used in the server-side code.
This setup creates a web application that collects user input, processes it with a backend service, and handles routing and caching through service workers and Webpack.
